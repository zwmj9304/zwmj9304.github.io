# Eggzie3D
A 3D software package for rasterization, ray-tracing and animation.

## Work Summary
- Designed and implemented in C++ with OpenGL a rasterization routine that simulates pencil drawing.
- Implemented multi-threaded photo-realistic rendering based on the Bidirectional Scattering Distribution model.
- Designed and implemented a workflow that uses motion capture data to generate skeleton based animation.
